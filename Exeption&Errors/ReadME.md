Exception handling in python: So we have try, except, else and finally blocks in python programming language 
we put the executable part of our code in the try block and catch the exception in the except block 
if use esle block it work like in if else   when there is exception in the code the else block is not executed  if there is no exception in 
the code then else part is also executed ok
